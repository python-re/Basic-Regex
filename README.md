# Basic-Regex

The nature of regular expressions are typically complex to those that are new to coding. The primary purpose of regular expressions (referred to as Regex oftentimes), is to identify patterns. Such programs are extremely useful when working with contextual algorithms or code that produces a sequence of strings, integers, and et cetera. When done correctly, regular expressions enable developers to easily examine materials that consist of thousands of entires.

This program takes a brief step into a fraction of the power that Regex holds. Two lists are supplied; List of Fruits.txt and List of Vegetables.txt. It is acceptable and recommended that different lists of values be used to see how the program responds. The lists are short so as to reduce the amount of time that it takes for computers to compile results--although longer lists may be used if desired.

Please note that the program is highly interactive--consiting of multiple parts that require the end-user to follow the input functionality that Python has to offer. It is recommended that you run such programs through a Command Prompt, Terminal, or through an IDE besides IDLE. A couple of notes that should be considered before running the program:

  1. [import sys] is used to end the program after all attempts have been used.
  2. [import time] is implemented to monitor and reduce CPU usage.
  3. [iimport re] is the regular expression module. You must know how to use Regex statements in order for the program to compile correctly. Supply a word such as      "Fruit," for instance, will cause the program to search the two documents for any part of the document containing "Fruit."
  4. Two of the three "games" are completed. The third one will break as no actual code exists for it yet. This program is a work in progress and is subject to        serious revisions.
  5. Lines are printed to separate parts. The lines may be repalced with tabs when the program is completed.
